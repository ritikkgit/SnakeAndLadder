Snakes and Ladders Game (Low-Level Design)
This project is a low-level design implementation of the classic Snakes and Ladders game in Java. It is built to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts for low-level system design interview questions.

Features
Multiple players
Random dice rolls
Snakes and ladders mechanics
Console-based interaction
How to Run
Clone the repository.
Compile and run the Main.java file in a Java development environment.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
Purpose
This project is intended for practicing low-level system design concepts such as:

Object-oriented design (OOP)
Class interactions (Player, Board, Game, Snake, Ladder)
Game logic with user interaction
This README is designed to guide interviewers or anyone reviewing the code that itâ€™s specifically for LLD practice.
